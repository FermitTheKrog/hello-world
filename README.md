# hello-world
GitHub made me do it!
GitHub told me to come here and say a bit about myself... If anyone is reading this... Please, stop the GitHub slavery machine! They forcing me to do such weird things! It's like Matlock is trying to give me a backrub...
It's like Andy Rooney is telling me to shut up and dance!
It's like grumpy old man but not hilarious!
It's like the bucket list but not uplifting!
It's like someone got lost on their way to a golden girls orgy!
It's like cocoon but somehow more gross!
It's like I'm at a rave with Wilford Brimley!
Hi! I'm Masi Oka from Heroes...
